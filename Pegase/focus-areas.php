            <h3>Tele radiology</h3>
            <p class="font-italic">
            Tele radiology is the transmission of radiological patient images, such as x-rays, CTs, and MRIs, from one location to another for the purposes of sharing studies with other radiologists and physicians. Tele radiology improves patient care by allowing radiologists to provide services without actually having to be at the location of the patient. This is particularly important when a sub-specialist such as a MRI radiologist, neuro radiologist, pediatric radiologist, or musculoskeletal radiologist is needed, since these professionals are generally only located in large metropolitan areas working during daytime hours. Tele radiology allows for trained specialists to be available 24/7.

            <h3>Tele-Dermatology</h3>
            <p class="font-italic">
            Direct consultation involves an individual with a skin condition contacting a dermatologist via telecommunication to request diagnosis and treatment. In this field, mobile applications of tele-dermatology gain importance.
            </p>
            <p>
            Tele diagnosis in the absence of personal contact with health care workers to the individual is complex. It requires active participation of the individual and without appropriate guidance may lead to improper management. However, as a triage tool, leading the individual directly to the appropriate specialist for his/her disease, it could be very valuable in the near future.
            </p>
            <p>
            Specialist referral is a major area of application in tele dermatology A general practitioner (or other medical professional) that sees the individual consults a specialist/ specialised centre via telecommunication in order to get a second opinion. The specialist then helps the GP in rendering a diagnosis, providing management options et cetera.
